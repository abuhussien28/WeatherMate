# WeatherMate
Weather Mate suggests appropriate clothes based on the current temperature, so you never have to wonder whether to wear a t-shirt or a sweater again.

Using the okhttp library 🌦, I fetch temperature data from an open weather API and then make clothing suggestions accordingly ⛅. 
I organized the code using the MVP architecture pattern so it's clean, modular, and easy to maintain as the app grows 👔😎
